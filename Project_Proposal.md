### Introduction

The purpose of this project proposal is to provide introduction to the rock properties database, to illustrate the preliminary exploratory data analysis, to explain the methodogy of data analysis of this project. 


### Background 

The Canadian Rock Physical Property Database (CRPPD) includes rock petrophysical measurements on over 20,000 observations collected during the last 40 years. Geographysically ranging from the Canadian Precambrian Shield to the east coast to the Athabasca Sedimentary Basin towards west, this database contains nearly all types of rocks to be found across Canada. First released in 2018, this database is publicly accessible for non-commercial purposes.
